    "Attached is a csv file of Twitter data. The file is called \"tweet_sample.csv\". As you probably know, \"csv\" stands for comma separated values. Before processing the files open it Excel or OpenOffice. Take a look at the columns and try to get an overall sense of the data. The columns are named **'ItemID', 'Sentiment', 'SentimentText'**. \n",

    "1. Read the file into a dataframe.   \n",
    "2. Split the dataframe into two dataframes of sizes 80% and 20% (of the original) respectively. The entries of the two later dataframes must be selceted randomly from the original.   \n",
    "3. Swap the columns '**SentimentText**' and '**Sentiment**'\n",
    "3. Save the two newly created dataframes as csv files \"train.csv\" and \"test.csv\" in the current folder (so no path) with new names for the columns \"**TweetText**\" and \"**TweetSentiment**\". This is a standard procedure in supervised learning. \n",
    "4. Create 2 lists of the tweets, \"trainList\" and \"testList\" and remove stopwords from each entry. You may use nltk stopwords.    \n",
    "5. Use **TweetTokenizer** from **nltk.tokenize** to tokenize the tweets. We have to use a special tokenizer because Twitter has it's own dialect!    \n",
    "6. Is it it a good idea to remove stopwards? Justify your answer in 2-3 sentences.   "
