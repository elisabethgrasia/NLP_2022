    "It is more difficult because the word's pattern becomes more complicated. To create the piglatin word, it simply detects any consonant letter by detecting the first vocal letter that appears for the first time and move the consonant letter into the end of the word. Then, add 'ay' after that. When it comes to put it back, one of the issue is not every word in English begin with consonant. For example, \"it\" becomes 'itay' in PigLatin. The pattern to bring the word back will be more complex because once we put the consonant in front and remove the 'ay', but it will become 'ti'."
